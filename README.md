### Hi there ðŸ‘‹<br />
About me:<br />
I am a graduated aviation engineer with three years of commercial experience in the airline industry, where I worked with the Boeing 787. I am now seeking challenges and opportunities in the IT field. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in computer science and data science, and working on my thesis project, which involves using machine learning algorithms to make predictions and automate decision-making based on data.<br />

I have a strong foundation in statistics and probability, and I am experienced in using data analysis and machine learning techniques. My experience in the airline industry has also honed my communication, negotiation, and problem-solving skills, and I am confident in my ability to think critically and creatively to find solutions. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge in a data science role, and I am open to learning new technologies and techniques to advance my career.

  - [Flower Classification model/Transfer learning VGG16/ResNet/MobileNet](https://github.com/IgorNowacki/Transfer-learning-VGG16-ResNet-MobileNet-) - I utilized transfer learning to build a convolutional neural network for classifying flowers photos. The pre-trained models that will be used for this purpose are VGG16, ResNet, and MobileNet.
  - [Chest X Ray Images Classification/Pneumonia detection CNN](https://github.com/IgorNowacki/Chest-X-Ray-Images-classification---Pneumonia-detection-CNN-) -  Convolutional Neural Network to predict if X ray image shows healthy lungs or lungs with Pneumonia.
  - [Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/IgorNowacki/car-price-prediction) - Linear Regression, Laso Regression model, Ridge Regression model, Random Forest to predict the value of used cars.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹<br />
About me:<br />
I am a graduated aviation engineer with three years of commercial experience in the airline industry, where I worked with the Boeing 787. I am now seeking challenges and opportunities in the IT field. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in computer science and data science, and working on my thesis project, which involves using machine learning algorithms to make predictions and automate decision-making based on data.<br />

I have a strong foundation in statistics and probability, and I am experienced in using data analysis and machine learning techniques. My experience in the airline industry has also honed my communication, negotiation, and problem-solving skills, and I am confident in my ability to think critically and creatively to find solutions. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge in a data science role, and I am open to learning new technologies and techniques to advance my career."

In addition to these technical skills, data scientists also need to have strong problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity skills,
